# My-Lana-Art
When I was in high school, I had a really cringey and funny Lana Del Rey phase. This was around 2016. I still love Lana Del Rey to this day but I am not obsessed with her anymore. In those days, recoloring her photos was a big trend. I recolored more than ten pictures back then and I believed I was a pro at recoloring. This summarizes what went through my brain at 16 years old. Nowadays, I do not care for recoloring any of Lana's pictures. But sharing this shows me in a cute light.
